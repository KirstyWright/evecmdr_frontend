        I was initially employed alongside my apprenticeship and then I stayed on as a full stack developer. <br>
        Whilst my role is a fullstack developer, my projects mainly consist of websites requiring bespoke systems or admin interfaces. I have gained experience in building mobile apps via Cordova as well as PHP based APIs to go with them. I have built many sites ranging from ecommerce sites with third party inventory management integrations to booking systems for hotels.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Turning PSD and PDF designs into fully fledged websites.</li>
        <li>Building complex and secure web applications and systems.</li>
        <li>Constantly tweaking applications to changes in client specs.</li>
        <li>Communicating with clients regularly with updates and to receive feedback.</li>

    Clevergirls is an online gaming community and news site dedicated to promoting and informing players about online games that interest its audience. Content includes articles, podcasts, streaming and a host of other features yet to be released. I worked as the sole developer on the project and was tasked with building both the front and backends of the site. The frontend was customer facing and displayed articles and other content that was written by authors on the site. The backend contained a simple system for content authors to write articles and upload content. This was then proof read by editors who would make edits before submitting the finished pieces to the site.
