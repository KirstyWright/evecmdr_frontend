        This opportunity is being worked alongside my apprenticeship. Complex projects I have worked on include an information site for Vodafone and an internal pension calculator for Tesco. More recently I have built an internal game app for Wagamama. Whilst my role is a fullstack developer, my projects mainly consist of websites requiring bespoke systems or admin interfaces.

    <ul>
        <li>Turning PSD and PDF designs into fully fledged websites.</li>
        <li>Building complex and secure web applications and systems.</li>
        <li>Constantly tweaking applications to changes in client specs.</li>
        <li>Communicating with clients regularly with updates and to receive feedback.</li>

    Clevergirls is an online gaming community and news site dedicated to promoting and informing players about online games that interest its audience. Content includes articles, podcasts, streaming and a host of other features yet to be released. I worked as the sole developer on the project and was tasked with building both the front and backends of the site. The frontend was customer facing and displayed articles and other content that was written by authors on the site. The backend contained a simple system for content authors to write articles and upload content. This was then proof read by editors who would make edits before submitting the finished pieces to the site.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Backend with multiple user levels.<ul>
        <li>Managment of users and groups.</li>
        <li>Author interface to create and draft articles.</li>
        <li>Editor interface to edit and release articles.</li>
        <li>Streamer interface to schedule streams for display in the timetable.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Tag system for filtering articles.</li>
    <li>Article categories to allow for podcasts and blogs.</li>
    <li>Streamer timetable with links to twitch and other streaming services.</li>
    <li>Commenting on articles with Disqus.</li>
